9.2.16 - 22nd June 2022

More transforms will be added to this in future (feel free to make suggestions).
- The 'Faster movie skip' option ('System') has a new setting that lets you skip movies played inside instances automatically.  It's disabled by default.

- Fixed an issue which caused the 'Razorwings' setting ('Mute game sounds' in 'System') to not mute the mount sounds.

9.1.35 - 22nd December 2021
- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.  Special thanks to tflo for providing valuable feedback and axelady for updating ZonePet with LibDBIcon.

9.1.34 - 18th December 2021
- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed an issue with TomCatTours non-standard minimap button.

- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.

9.1.31 - 15th December 2021
- For 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface'), added a new setting to give you the choice of whether to show the new covenant button on the round minimap (it will always be shown on the square minimap regardless of this setting).  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.

9.1.30 - 11th December 2021
- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).
- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.
- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').

9.1.29 - 9th December 2021
- For 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface'), the garrison button will no longer obscure the queue status button when using the round minimap.

9.1.28 - 8th December 2021
- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  The covenant button has been updated with a new texture.  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).

9.1.27 - 2nd December 2021
- Added 'Razorwings' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').
- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Fixed an issue which caused minimap instance difficulty icons to be positioned incorrectly.
- Removed the temporary vehicle frame fix from 'Manage frames' ('Frames') now that Blizzard has fixed the bug in the default UI.

9.1.26 - 2nd December 2021

- Added a new option 'Hide bags and micro' ('Frames').  If enabled, bags and microbuttons will not be shown.
- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.
- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.
- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.
- If 'Manage frames' ('Frames') is enabled, the player frame will no longer disapppear after entering/exiting certain vehicles (this is a bug in the default UI and not caused by addons).
- If 'Hide event toasts' ('Frames') is enabled and you want the Torghast floor summary to fade as soon as you have finished reading it, right-click any of the highlighted rows in the floor summary then move the pointer away from the floor summary.  The floor summary will start to fade instantly.
- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.

9.1.24 - 24th November 2021
- The 'Hide level-up display' ('Frames') option is now called 'Hide event toasts'.  The new option will not hide Torghast floor and instance completion toasts.
- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which caused the animation slider and item slot buttons to show for mount and pet previews.

9.1.23 - 17th November 2021
- On the 'Social' page, you can now specify that guild members and members of your communities should be treated as friends for all of the options on the 'Social' page.  Previously, guild members were always treated as friends but now it's optional.
- Added 'Furlines' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This applies to Sunwarmed Furline.
- Added a new option 'Easy mount special' ('System').  If enabled, you can press CTRL/SPACE to trigger your mount's special animation.  Also works with shapeshifted forms.
- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.
- The minimum delay and the default delay for 'Release in PvP' ('Automation') is now 0ms (was 200ms).
- If 'Manage frames' ('Frames') is enabled, a temporary fix has been added for the game bug introduced in patch 9.1.5 which causes the player frame to reset when entering or exiting a vehicle.  The temporary fix will attempt to restore the player frame to your chosen location when you enter or exit a vahicle.  If you are in combat, the frame position will be restored when you leave combat.  This temporary fix will be removed once Blizzard fixes the bug in the game code.  The bug itself is not caused by addons.
- Many thanks to Alex Folland for his especially valuable feedback.

9.1.22 - 10th November 2021
- Added two new settings to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').  One shows item buttons in the dressing room and the other shows a model animation slider.

All require a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply to the currently showing model (either your character or your target).  Transformations such as shapeshift or appearance change toys will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  All of the dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.

- Removed the 'Shouts' setting from 'Mute game sounds' ('System') as the sounds that it muted don't appear to be used by the game anymore.
